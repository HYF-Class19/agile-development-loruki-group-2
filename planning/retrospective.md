## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Planning went well as expected.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Website rebuild went slow due to the coding knowledge level of different
  members of the group

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?

  experience.
